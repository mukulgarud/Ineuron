    "Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Advantages of function usage in program are as follows:\n",
    "1) Code Reusability, when we want use a same block of code multiple times then we write that code inside function to use it again and again.\n",
    "2) Easy to update and read, whenever we have to update the code we have to only make changes inside function block once, not every time we use it. \n",
    "3) Reduces duplicate code, as we have to use same block of code again and again duplication of code happens inside program so insted of that we use function to write code once and call whenever we needed. \n"
